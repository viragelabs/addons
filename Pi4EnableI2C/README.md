# Introduction
This add-on enables the Raspberry Pi I<sup>2</sup>C bus to allow the fan in a [VirageHub](https://www.viragelabs.com/products/#hub) to be controlled from within Home Assistant (using the Virage Hub Cooling Add-on).  Once enabled, you can also connect other sensors or hardware devices to the Raspberry Pi I<sup>2</sup>C bus as well.

Thanks to [Adam Outler](https://github.com/adamoutler) for creating this add-on.

## Installation

Go to the **Virage Addon Repository** section, and click on the **HassOS I2C Configurator** icon, and then on **Install** in the subsequent screen.

## Operation
No configuration is needed.  Click the start button and observe the logs (see Documentation).  You may uninstall the Add-on when complete.
