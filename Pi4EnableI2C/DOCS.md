No configuration is needed to run this Add-on.  After installing it, start it and read the Logs (be sure to click **Refresh**).  After the first run, the log entry will
indicate that you will need to perform a hard (i.e. disconnect power from the Pi) reboot.  When Home Assistant restarts, start the Add-on again and read the Logs.  The logs will
again indicate that you need to perform a hard reboot.  After Home Assistant restarts, start the Add-On again, and it should indicate in the Logs that I2C is properly installed.
